# TimeSpaceAdvancedAge
Data from a study on age-related differences in time-space interferences using 3D and 2D stimuli. Results: Older adults' spatial judgments are more affected by irrelevant temporal info (time-on-space effect) than younger adults, with no significant age difference in space-on-time effect. No correlation with cognitive functioning.
